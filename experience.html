                <p>When I chose to study Computer Science I decided to learn python as a project to help
                    solidify the concepts I learned I made a simple snake game.

                <img src="projects/raycaster.png" alt="raycaster image">
                <p>I found that one of my weaker points was implementing mathematics in my coding to help practice
                    this I created a primitive raycaster using only OpenGL along with some standard C libraries.

                <img src="projects/EMSReportingSite.png" alt="emergency services reporting image">
                <p>During a group project I created a simple site for reporting emergencies.
                    Users of the site can input a type of emergency their info and their location and then the emergency
                    would appear on a map. Another page also allowed for administrators with a password to edit and delete
                    emergencies as they evolved or were resolved.
